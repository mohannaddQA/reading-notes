# Node Ecosystem

when we started learning about JavaScript , we used to write our code and see the results on the browser, because the browser acts as an environment that can execute our JS code.

**what if you don't have a browser, or you want to execute your code outside the browser?**
this is why node.js is important, as it solves this problem and provide an environment to execute JavaScript codes without the need for a browser to do this.

**ok ... but why would you need to execute JavaScript outside the browser ??**
the most important case is server-side development.
Node.js enables you to write server-side code using JavaScript. With Node.js, you can create web servers, handle HTTP requests, process data, interact with databases, and perform other server-side tasks.

### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

first, I would explain to him that JavaScript is a programming language used to create web applications.
and like any programming language, whatever we write must be executed so it can be displayed to the user, this is what the browser does, it runs the JavaScript codes that we write.
second, I would tell him that there are certain parts of we development codes, that can't be done in the client side (the browser), so we must have another environment or place to execute the code and this is what node JS is about, **_it's as simple as saying a place to execute JavaScript codes._**  
the browser is like a stage where you can see everything happen
and node.js is like behind the scene where somethings we don't want it to be on the stage.

### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

it means that Node.js provides an environment or platform or a place where JavaScript code can be executed. and it's built on the same engine that google chrome uses to execute JS codes which is the V8 engine

### What is Node used for?

it's mainly used for Server-Side Web Development
Node.js allows you to build the server-side components of web applications. You can handle HTTP requests, process data, interact with databases, and communicate with the front-end side of the app .
