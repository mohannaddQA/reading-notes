# Event Driven Applications

### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

the "events" module

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) helps organize code into reusable objects with their own properties and behaviors. Event-Driven Programming (EDP) focuses on handling events and asynchronous interactions. Combining OOP with EDP allows for modular, maintainable code that responds to events with encapsulated logic. It provides a structured approach to managing complexity and promotes code reuse, while EDP enables effective event handling and asynchronous operations. Together, they create flexible and extensible systems.

### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event Driven Programming (EDP) in Node.js on the backend is like having a smart server that can handle many things at once. It listens for events (like requests or actions) and responds quickly without waiting. This makes the server fast and efficient, able to handle lots of users and real-time applications like chats or notifications.
