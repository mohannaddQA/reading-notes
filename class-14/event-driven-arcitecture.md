# Event Driven Architecture

## Discuss 2 possible project ideas

1- Real-Time Chat Application: Build a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate instantly. Users can join chat rooms or create private rooms to chat with specific individuals or groups. Socket.IO can be used to handle real-time messaging, room management, and broadcasting messages to relevant participants. Additional features like typing indicators, file sharing, and message history can also be implemented.

2- Multiplayer Game: Develop a multiplayer game that enables multiple players to interact and play together in real-time. Socket.IO can be used to synchronize game state, handle player movements and actions, and facilitate real-time communication between players. Implement features like game rooms, player matchmaking, leaderboards, and real-time notifications to enhance the gaming experience.
