### What is one of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

one of the most important considerations is the space-time complexity. The space complexity refers to the amount of memory or storage required by the data structure, while the time complexity refers to the efficiency of the operations performed on the data structure.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

you need to design your recursive functions in a way that ensures termination under all circumstances
