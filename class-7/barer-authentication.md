## 1- Intro to JWT

### What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe string used for securely transmitting information between parties. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.

### When should we use JSON Web Tokens?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are commonly used when you need a lightweight and stateless method for authentication and authorization. They are suitable for distributed systems, APIs, and single sign-on scenarios. JWTs are particularly useful when you want to enable secure communication between different domains or services without relying on server-side session

### Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?

Claims are expected to be present in the payload component of a JSON Web Token (JWT). The payload contains the statements or claims about the authenticated user or other relevant information. Claims can include user identity, roles, permissions, or any additional data that needs to be transmitted within the token.

## 2- Are JWTs Secure?

### If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?

When a JWT is decoded and the payload is accessible, it doesn't imply that the token itself is secure. The security of a JWT relies on the integrity and authenticity provided by the signature. The signature, which is generated using a secret or private key, ensures that the token hasn't been tampered with. The server, upon receiving the JWT, verifies the signature to ensure the token's authenticity and integrity. If the signature is valid, it confirms that the token was not modified, and therefore, it can be trusted.

### If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.

When sending a JSON Web Token (JWT), the sender and receiver must both know the secret key used to generate the signature. The secret key is appended in the signature component of the JWT. It is crucial for the receiver to have access to the same secret key in order to verify the integrity and authenticity of the token by recalculating the signature. This shared knowledge of the secret key is necessary for secure token verification.

### Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.

You can compare the concatenated content and secret to a locked box with two parts: the content and the key. The content represents the information, and the key represents the secret. To ensure security, the sender can lock the box using the key, and only the intended recipient, who possesses the matching key, can unlock and access the content. This way, the information remains secure during transmission.

## 3- JWTs Explained

### Why use JWT?

JWTs are used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. They are stateless, scalable, and widely supported. JWTs provide secure communication, easy integration, and include custom claims. They are lightweight, compact, and offer a flexible solution for authentication and authorization needs.

### JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.

Imagine you have a small, portable container that can hold all your important information securely. This container is compact, meaning it doesn't take up much space. Inside the container, you can store everything you need, like your identification, access permissions, or any other relevant details. This container is self-contained, meaning it carries all the necessary information within it, eliminating the need for external storage or additional paperwork. This way, you can easily carry your information around and share it securely with others, making things convenient and efficient. That's how a compact and self-contained JWT works, making it useful for securely transmitting and managing important data in a simplified manner.

### What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?

The JWT signature consists of three components:

Header: The header component of the signature contains information about the type of token and the signing algorithm used. It specifies how the signature should be validated.

Payload: The payload component holds the claims or statements about the authenticated user or other relevant information. It can include details like user identity, roles, permissions, or any additional data required.

Signature: The signature is generated by combining the header, payload, and a secret key or private key. It ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token. The signature is used to verify that the token hasn't been tampered with and can be trusted.

Together, these three components form a JWT signature, providing a secure and verifiable representation of the token's content.
